# SD Card Orientation Guide

## Quick Answer

**Most SD card readers**: Gold contacts (teeth) face **DOWN** when inserting.

**But**: Always check your specific reader!

## How to Tell Which Way

### Method 1: Look at the Reader
1. Look at the SD card slot in your reader
2. You should see **metal pins** inside the slot
3. The gold contacts on your SD card must **touch those pins**
4. Insert card so contacts face the pins

### Method 2: Check the Label
- Most SD cards have a **label on one side**
- Label usually faces **UP** (away from contacts)
- If label is up, contacts are down

### Method 3: Try Both Ways (Safely)
- Try inserting one way
- If it doesn't go in smoothly, **don't force it**
- Flip it over and try the other way
- Only one way will work

## Visual Guide

```

│  [PINS]     │  ← Metal pins here
│             │

## If You're Unsure

1. **Look at the slot** - see where the pins are
2. **Try gently** - if it doesn't go, flip it
3. **Check your reader manual** - if you have it
4. **Most common**: Contacts down works 90% of the time
